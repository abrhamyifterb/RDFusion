Whether you’re working with Turtle or JSON-LD 1.1, RDFusion:

- Highlights **inline syntax errors** as you type  
- Runs and highlights **SHACL shape validation** against your data model as you type 
- **Suggests vocabulary terms** (e.g. `foaf:`, `schema:`, `rdf:`) from both local files and remote registries  
- Lets you **group triples by subject** into compact blocks for readability as well as **filter triples** based on user input specification

## Features & Commands

### Inline Syntax & SHACL Validation
- RDFusion parses your Turtle and JSON-LD and flags errors and warnings inline right in the editor .
- RUN **“RDFusion: Toggle Turtle Validations”** and **“RDFusion: Toggle JSONLD Validations”** to enable and disable validation types, including duplicate triples detection in both Turtle and JSON-LD.
- RUN **“RDFusion: IRI Scheme Validation Configuration”** to customize how IRI schemes are validated in RDF documents (currently only pplies to ttl) — including enabling strict mode and defining a custom whitelist of allowed schemes (e.g., http, https, mailto, tel). 

### Prefix Suggestions
- As you start declaring prefix, RDFusion gives suggestions. RDFusion also gives an option to automatically declare prefix, after usage of undeclared prefix.

### Vocabulary Completion
As you type prefix names, RDFusion suggests terms from:
- **Local workspace** graphs  
- **Remote registries** (LOV API, Direct Dereference)  
- RUN **“RDFusion: Toggle Autocomplete”** to switch term completion between local, remote, or both sources. Also to enable/disable declaration of undeclared prefix.

### Triple Management  
- RUN **“RDFusion: Group by Subject”** to transform flat Turtle into grouped blocks.
- RUN **“RDFusion: Filter Triples By Subject-Predicate-Object”** to filter triples based on user specified subject, predicate, and object; supporting both full IRIs and prefixed names, as well as literal values. Filtered triples are shown in new untitled VS Code editor tab. 
- RUN **“RDFusion: Filter Triples By Subject”** to filter triples only based on user specified subjects; supporting both full IRIs and prefixed names. Filtered triples are shown in new untitled VS Code editor tab. 
- RUN **“RDFusion: Filter Triples By Predicate** to filter triples only based on user specified predicates; supporting both full IRIs and prefixed names. Filtered triples are shown in new untitled VS Code editor tab. 
- RUN **“RDFusion: Filter Triples By Object”** to filter triples only based on user specified objects; supporting both full IRIs and prefixed names. Filtered triples are shown in new untitled VS Code editor tab. 
- RUN **“RDFusion: Sort Triples by Subject Ascending”** to reorder all triples in the current Turtle editor tab by subject IRI in ascending order.
- RUN **“RDFusion: Sort Triples by Subject Descending** to reorder all triples in the current Turtle editor tab by subject IRI in descending order.
- RUN **“RDFusion: Sort Predicates within Subject Ascending”** to reorder predicate–object pairs inside each subject block in ascending order by predicate.
- RUN **“RDFusion: Sort Predicates within Subject Descending** to reorder predicate–object pairs inside each subject block in descending order by predicate.
- RUN **“RDFusion: Generate VoID”** to generate a Vocabulary of Interlinked Datasets. It will generate void:triples, void:distinctSubjects, void:distinctObjects, void:properties, void:propertyPartition, void:classPartition, and void:vocabulary for your current open ttl or jsonld file.
- RUN **“RDFusion: Merge Files”** to merge the current open ttl/jsonld file with another ttl or jsonld file. The merged data is grouped and shown in new untitled VS Code editor tab. Alternative option is to select ttl/jsonld files from Explorer and on right-click select  **“RDFusion: Merge Files”** option.
- RUN **“RDFusion: Toggle IRI Shortening”** to enable/disable IRI shortening and expansion in Turtle. Once enabled you can shorten and expand each IRI inside the editor.
- RUN **“RDFusion: Set IRI Shorten Length”** to set the maximum length before applying IRI shortening in Turtle.
- RUN **“RDFusion: Turtle Formatter”** formats Turtle triples in the current editor tab using your configured style rules.
- RUN **“RDFusion: Turtle Formatter Configuration”** to customize Turtle formatting style rules — including indentation, line breaks, predicateObjectlist formatting, and use of prefixes. 
- RUN **“RDFusion: Frame Jsonld From Template”** to apply a predefined JSON-LD frame to the current open jsonld editor tab.
